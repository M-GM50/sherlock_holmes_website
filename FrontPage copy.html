        <h3>THE AUTHOR</h3>

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            We owe the exciting stories of Sherlock Holmes to the Scotsman, Sir
            Arthur Conan Doyle. Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 may 1859, at
            Picardy Place, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Mary Josephine
            Foley, was Irish and descendant of the famous Percy family of
            Northumberland, in the line of Plantagenet. His father, Charles
            Altamont Doyle, was a not very ambitious officer with some artistic
            talent. When he lost his job, he sank into alcoholism and was
            interned after severe seizures before dying in 1893. The three
            brothers of his father distinguished themselves in England: James
            wrote The Chronicles of England, Henry was director of the National
            Gallery in Dublin and Richard was one of the most famous
            illustrators of Punch. Arthur was the second of seven children
            (Annette, Caroline, Constance, Innes, Jane and Bryan Mary).
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Doctor Watson, Sherlock's dear friend, Doyle was a doctor, an
            eye doctor to be precise. The character of Sherlock Holmes was
            actually inspired from one of his teachers, Doctor Joseph Bell. Like
            our beloved detective, he was a good observer and could tell a lot
            of things just by looking at a patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a gifted story teller, he wrote his first stoty aged 6. It
            was about a man who fought a Bengal tiger.

            Alongside his studies, Arthur tried to earn some money to help his
            family. In 1880, he worked as a medical assistant in Sheffield,
            Birmingham and Shropshire and doctor aboard a whaler, the Hope, in
            Greenland.
          </p>

          <p>
            On 22 october 1881, he graduated and enlisted as a doctor aboard a
            steamer (the SS Mayumba) to Western Africa. The voyage was
            unpleasant because of a storm and a fire on board, and Conan Doyle
            became seriously ill (probably malaria) in Lagos. He then decided to
            use his skills more peacefully. After a brief and disastrous
            partnership in 1882, with a colleague, Dr. George Turnavine Budd, he
            opened a practice of ophthalmology in Southsea, near Portsmouth. His
            clientele left him plenty of time to read, write and began to
            publish other short stories but without great success.

        <h3>SHERLOCK HOLMES</h3>

        <div class="text">

            Sherlock Holmes, fictional character created by the Scottish writer
            Arthur Conan Doyle. The prototype for the modern mastermind
            detective, Holmes first appeared in Conan Doyle’s A Study in
            Scarlet, published in Beeton’s Christmas Annual of 1887.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the world’s first and only “consulting detective,” he pursued
            criminals throughout Victorian and Edwardian London, the south of
            England, and continental Europe. Although the fictional detective
            had been anticipated by Edgar Allan Poe’s C. Auguste Dupin and Émile
            Gaboriau’s Monsieur Lecoq, Holmes made a singular impact upon the
            popular imagination and has been the most enduring character of the
            detective story.

          <p>
            Conan Doyle modeled Holmes’s methods and mannerisms on those of Dr.
            Joseph Bell, who had been his professor at the University of
            Edinburgh Medical School. In particular, Holmes’s uncanny ability to
            gather evidence based upon his honed skills of observation and
            deductive reasoning paralleled Bell’s method of diagnosing a
            patient’s disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holmes offered some insight into his method, claiming that “When you
            have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable,
            must be the truth.” His detecting abilities become clear, though no
            less amazing, when explained by his companion, Dr. John H. Watson,
            who recounts the criminal cases they jointly pursue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Holmes rebuffs praise, declaring his abilities to be
            “elementary,” the oft-quoted phrase “Elementary, my dear Watson,”
            never actually appears in Conan Doyle’s writings.
